# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tszon Tseng :)

I'm currently a **Data Science Intern** at [BEAT](https://www.beatzero.co.uk/) (Better Environment and Transportation) since June 2025 🌍.  
Actively seeking **long-term Data Science / AI roles in 2025**!

## 🚀 About Me

🎯 **Aspiring Data Scientist & AI Engineer**, certified by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/AEDS0014305898265)  

🎓 **BSc in Astrophysics with Space Science (UK)**

I started by studying galaxies, but found my real passion in **data-driven discovery**. Today, I design **end-to-end ML projects**—from raw data pipelines to interactive dashboards—that reveal insights and drive smarter decisions.  

✨ Currently focused on:
- ⚡ **Scientific Computing & Simulation** : Transportation sector
- 🧠 **LLMs & Generative AI**: Hugging Face, fine-tuning transformers  
- 📈 **Time-Series Forecasting**: LSTM, CNNs, SARIMAX for predictive analytics  
- 🔎 **Interpretable ML**: SHAP, LIME for model transparency
