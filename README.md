## 🚀 About Me

🎯 **Aspiring Data Scientist & AI Engineer**, certified by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/AEDS0014305898265)  

🎓 **BSc in Astrophysics with Space Science (1st Class)**

I started by studying galaxies, but found my real passion in **data-driven discovery**. Today, I design **end-to-end ML projects** from raw data pipelines to interactive dashboards that reveal insights and drive smarter decisions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages**  
`Python` | `SQL (PostgreSQL, Snowflake)` | `Bash` | `LaTeX`

**Data Science & ML**  
`Pandas` `NumPy` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `SciPy`  
`Scikit-learn` `XGBoost` `PyTorch` `SHAP` `LIME`  
`emcee` (Bayesian Inference)

**Tools & Platforms**  
`Git & GitHub` | `Docker` | `VS Code` | `Streamlit` | `MLflow`

✨ Currently focused on:
- ⚡ **Scientific Computing & Simulation** : Transportation sector
- 🧠 **LLMs & Generative AI**: Hugging Face, fine-tuning transformers  
- 📈 **Time-Series Forecasting**: LSTM, CNNs, SARIMAX for predictive analytics  
- 🔎 **Interpretable ML**: SHAP, LIME for model transparency

## 📂 Featured Projects

📊 **[End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Tszon/End-to-End_DS_ML_Project)**  
- Built an **ML pipeline** (Logistic Regression, RF, XGBoost, Voting Classifier) → **ROC-AUC: 0.87**  
- Applied **KMeans & HDBSCAN clustering** with UMAP to segment customers into actionable personas  
- Used **SHAP explainability** to reveal key churn drivers (tenure, contract type, fibre optic service)  
- Deployed interactive **[Streamlit App](https://tszontseng-telco-end2end-customer-churn-project.streamlit.app/)** for business users  
- Containerised workflow with **Docker**, reducing setup time by >80% and ensuring reproducibility  
- Tracked experiments, metrics, and models with **MLflow**, improving transparency and versioning across the pipeline  
- Designed an **A/B testing simulator** with Chi-Square tests to measure the impact of retention strategies
