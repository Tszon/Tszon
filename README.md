## 🚀 About Me

With a background in astrophysics and a growing portfolio in machine learning, I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with data. Whether it’s building LLM apps, forecasting sales with deep learning, or exploring interpretable AI, I’m constantly pushing my limits to learn, build, and innovate.

I'm currently focused on:
- 🧠 LLM development with LangChain & Hugging Face
- 📈 Time-series forecasting with deep learning (LSTMs, CNNs, SARIMAX)
- 🔎 Building interpretable and responsible AI systems
- 🔬 Scientific computing & simulation
